Practical 1

Practical  - Write a program to calculate Fibonacci numbers and find its step count.

Codes - 

package sanketscode;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class FibonacciSeries {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter Number - ");
		int num = sc.nextInt();
		if(num <= 1) {
			System.out.println(num);
			return;
		}
		
		int a=0;
		int b=1;
		System.out.println(a);
	
		
		for(int i=1;i< num;i++) {
			System.out.println(b);
			int temp =a;
			a=b;
			b+=temp;
		}
		

	}

}


Explanation - In these program we are getting fibonacci series numbers if we want n number of  series then the complexity or step becomes o(n) so here in these program
The steps are 10 are regular and 4 are depend on number means ( n ) so 10 + 4(n) steps are required.
